Week 1: Basic Python Programming
Python syntax, data types, and functions
Data structures: Lists, dictionaries, tuples
List comprehensions and lambda functions

Week 2: Introduction to Pandas
Series and DataFrames
Data manipulation and cleaning
Importing/exporting data (CSV, Excel)

Week 3: Data Analysis with Pandas
Grouping, aggregating, and filtering data
DataFrame operations
Pivot tables and cross-tabulations

Week 4: Data Visualization
Basics of Matplotlib
Creating and customizing visualizations

### 2. Setup and Requirements
